**This code is  part of our new project titled "Keyed Pixel Orbit Encryption: A Lightweight Spatial Permutation Framework for Secure Image Protection" which is ongoing review process in reputed journal.**

1. Run the Python code (PgmNew2.py) for single image processing.
2. Results will be saved in output folder (rename the folder name as per yours). Authors used Giza.jpg as input image and output6 as the output folder.

 **For datset processing and analysis**
1. Download the dataset ( for eg,: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balabaskar/wonders-of-the-world-image-classification)
2. Run the code (dataset-plots.py) for processing and (dataset-plots1.py) for analysis results.
   (Kindly reduce the number  of images from the dataset for easy faster pprocessing)
